# Adding SPARQL queries

In this page we make use of the [SPARQL Plugin](https://github.com/max-ionov/vitepress-plugin-sparql). This is an internal link to the [home](/index.md) page.

Check out the following SPARQL queries:
- check out all the [definitions]('/sparql/dbnary') of an English word in [DBNary](http://kaiko.getalp.org/about-dbnary/);
- check all the [translations](/sparql/dbnary) of a given English word in DBNary
- check out the [philosophical expressions](/sparql/latin-philosophy) in Latin (from Giovanna Tonazzo's [project](https://github.com/tonazzog/PhiloLatin)).

The last example will showcase how to use a local file, i.e. a `ttl` file that *is not* interrogated via a SPARQL endpoint. Logically, you can do the same with any `ttl` file you develop yourself!
